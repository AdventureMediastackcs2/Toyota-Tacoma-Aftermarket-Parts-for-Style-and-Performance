                    <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Designed to Highlight Your Tacoma’s Character</span></h2>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>The Tacoma has always stood out in the truck world, but every owner knows there’s joy in making it uniquely yours. Our Hyper Stripe Kit was made with that in mind, custom fit for the 2024 model year and precision cut to flow with the natural lines of the truck.</span></p>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>Unlike generic stripe kits that need trimming or force you to “make it work,” our design hugs your Tacoma’s body with clean, factory-style edges. The result is a finish that looks as if it came straight from the manufacturer, only with your personal style added.</span></p>
                    <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Key Highlights That Make the Difference</span></h2>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>We’ve put a lot of thought into what makes a stripe kit worth the investment. With the Hyper Stripe Kit, you’ll enjoy:</span></p>
                    <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Perfect Fitment</span><span> – Tailored specifically for the 2024 Toyota Tacoma.</span><span><br><br></span></p>
                    <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Durable Vinyl</span><span> – Made from high-quality </span><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab71aa"><span>automotive-grade</span></a><span> vinyl that resists UV damage and weather wear.</span><span><br><br></span></p>
                    <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Color Options</span><span> – Choose a look that matches your Tacoma’s paint or stands out with contrast.</span><span><br><br></span></p>

                    <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Why Our Stripe Kit Is Worth It</span></h2>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>Custom paint jobs and professional detailing can cost thousands, and once it’s done, you’re locked into that look. The Hyper Stripe Kit offers flexibility, affordability, and a factory-like finish, all without touching your original paint.</span></p>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>We also know Tacoma drivers care about durability. That’s why we use premium vinyl that’s made to last. It holds up in the sun, in the rain, and even after countless car washes. Years from now, your stripes will look just as sharp as the day you applied them.</span></p>
                    <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What’s Inside the Kit</span></h2>

                    <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>● Access to our support team if you run into questions</span></p>
